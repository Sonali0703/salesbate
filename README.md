# SalesBets - Flutter (Interview Assignment)

## What this repo contains
A Flutter app demonstrating a simplified Sales Bets platform:
- Email/password auth (Firebase Auth)
- Dashboard with events
- Teams & team profile pages
- Betting flow with **no-loss** mechanic (stakes recorded but credits not reduced)
- Wallet / credits stored in Firestore
- Live stream placeholder with chat (Firestore)

## Quick setup
1. Clone repo:
   `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Create Firebase project and enable Auth, Firestore, Storage, FCM.
3. Copy `firebase_options.dart` generated by `flutterfire` CLI into `lib/`.
4. `flutter pub get`
5. Run:
   `flutter run` or `flutter run -d <device>`

## Important notes
- Bets are settled by a demo button in the Event screen. In production, use Cloud Functions to settle bets from a trusted event result.
- Do not place production secrets in the repo.

## What to demo (Loom)
1. Login / signup
2. Place a bet (show stake recorded, credits unchanged)
3. Settle a bet (simulate result) -> show credits increase and win animation
4. Open live stream placeholder and send chat messages
5. Show folder structure and key files: `wallet_service.dart`, `bets_provider.dart`
